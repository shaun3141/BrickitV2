-- Migration: Setup for Resend audience integration
-- Note: User addition to audience is handled client-side via the add-user-to-audience edge function
-- This migration documents the integration approach

-- The existing handle_new_user() function continues to work as before
-- Client-side code (AuthContext) will call the add-user-to-audience edge function
-- after successful authentication

-- No database schema changes needed - this migration is for documentation only
SELECT 1; -- Placeholder to make migration valid
