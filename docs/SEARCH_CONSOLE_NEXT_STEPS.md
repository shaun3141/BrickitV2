## üéØ Automation Options (Optional)

### Option A: Manual Monitoring (Easiest)

### Option B: Google Search Console API (Advanced)
If you want to automate updates, you can use the API:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

# Set up OAuth credentials (requires Google Cloud Console setup)
# Then use API to submit sitemaps programmatically
```

**API Endpoints:**
- Submit sitemap: `POST https://www.googleapis.com/webmasters/v3/sites/{siteUrl}/sitemaps/{feedpath}`
- Inspect URL: `POST https://www.googleapis.com/webmasters/v3/urlInspection/index:inspect`

### Option C: GitHub Actions (Future)
Could create a GitHub Action that:
- Resubmits sitemap after deployments
- Checks for indexing errors
- Reports to you via email

## üìä Important Metrics to Track

### Week 1-2
- Is homepage indexed? (Check URL Inspection)
- Any coverage errors?

### Week 2-4
