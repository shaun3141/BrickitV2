# Quick Fix: Access sitemap.xml for Search Console

## The Problem
The server deployment has ES module import issues causing crashes. The sitemap.xml and robots.txt files exist but the server isn't responding.

## Quick Solution: Access Files Directly

While we fix the server issues, you can access your SEO files directly to submit to Search Console:

### Option 1: Direct GitHub Link (Temporary)
Your files are in the repo, so you can reference them via GitHub raw URLs:

**robots.txt:** 
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shaun3141/BrickitV2/main/client/public/robots.txt
```

**sitemap.xml:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shaun3141/BrickitV2/main/client/public/sitemap.xml
```

**Note:** For Search Console, you need the actual domain URLs, not GitHub. This is just to preview.

### Option 2: Submit Local Content to Search Console

1. Go to Search Console â†’ your property
2. Click **Sitemaps**
3. Instead of submitting URL, you can manually tell Google about your pages via:
   - **URL Inspection** tool: Submit individual URLs
   - After server is fixed, submit the sitemap

### Option 3: Temporary Workaround

Since the sitemap is just pointing to your homepage, you can:

1. Use URL Inspection in Search Console
2. Enter: `https://brickit.build/`
3. Click "Request Indexing"
4. Google will crawl your site even without the sitemap

## What We're Fixing

The issue is ES module imports in Node.js require `.js` extensions. We're updating the codebase to add these extensions to all relative imports. 

Expected fix time: ~15 minutes

## Priority Actions

**For Search Console RIGHT NOW:**
1. Go to URL Inspection
2. Enter `https://brickit.build/`
3. Request indexing
4. Your homepage will be indexed even if sitemap isn't accessible yet

The sitemap is just a convenience file - the real submission happens through indexing requests.
