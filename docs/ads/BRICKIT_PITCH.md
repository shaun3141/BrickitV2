## The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

BrickIt converts your photos into LEGO mosaics, but here's what makes it different: it exports a CSV that uploads directly to LEGO's Pick a Brick website. One click, and all your bricks are in your cart. Plus, when LEGO doesn't make a brick in a certain color, BrickIt automatically substitutes available alternatives. No more designing mosaics you can't actually build.

## The Problem (SEO-Optimized)

### What people search for:
- "how to turn photo into LEGO mosaic"
- "LEGO mosaic maker free online"
- "custom LEGO portrait from photo"
- "LEGO parts list generator"

### What they actually need:
1. **Easy conversion** — Upload photo, get mosaic
2. **Real LEGO colors** — Not theoretical colors, actual available bricks
3. **One-click ordering** — Not manual entry of hundreds of parts
4. **Part availability** — Knowing what actually exists before designing

### What competitors miss:
- Basic converters stop at the pretty picture
- Desktop software requires installation and learning curves
- No tool generates Pick a Brick-compatible exports
- Part availability is universally ignored

## Social Media Posts (Ready to Use)

### Twitter/X — Feature Highlight
```
Turn photos into LEGO mosaics you can actually build 🧱

Most mosaic tools ignore a brutal truth: half the brick/color combos don't exist.

BrickIt:
✅ Exports directly to Pick a Brick
✅ Auto-substitutes unavailable parts
✅ Free, no install, no account

Try it: brickit.build
```

### Twitter/X — Story Angle
```
11 years ago I built a free LEGO mosaic maker as a college student.

It went offline. Life happened.

In 2024, LEGO added CSV upload to Pick a Brick.

In 2025, I rebuilt the whole thing with AI—zero code written by hand.

The result: brickit.build

Free. Actually works. Finally.
```

### Twitter/X — Problem-Solution
```
The LEGO mosaic workflow is broken:

1. Design mosaic
2. Manually enter 200+ parts into Pick a Brick
3. Discover half don't exist
4. Recalculate everything
5. Repeat

BrickIt fixes it:
- CSV export → one-click ordering
- Auto-substitutions → everything buildable

brickit.build
```

### LinkedIn
```
I built my first LEGO mosaic maker in 2014 as a college project.

11 years later, I rebuilt it without writing a single line of code.

The problem hasn't changed: most tools help you design mosaics that literally can't be built. LEGO doesn't make every brick in every color.

What changed:
• LEGO added CSV upload to Pick a Brick (2024)
• AI can now build complete web apps from descriptions

The result: BrickIt
- Exports directly to Pick a Brick
- Auto-substitutes unavailable parts
- Free, privacy-focused, no install

Sometimes the best features come from solving your own frustrations.

### Instagram Caption
```
Photo → LEGO mosaic → Actually buildable 🧱✨

The secret most mosaic tools ignore: half the brick/color combos don't exist.

BrickIt solves this:
• Exports directly to Pick a Brick
• Auto-substitutes unavailable colors
• Step-by-step building instructions
• 100% free

Because a mosaic you can't build isn't really a mosaic.

Title: I rebuilt my LEGO mosaic maker after 11 years — now with Pick a Brick CSV export

I originally built BrickIt back in 2014 as a college project. It converted photos to LEGO mosaics and generated parts lists. People seemed to like it, but eventually the site went offline.

Fast forward to 2024: LEGO quietly added CSV upload to Pick a Brick. Game changer.

So I rebuilt the whole thing with two features no other mosaic tool has:

1. **Pick a Brick CSV export** — Download a file, upload to LEGO's site, entire cart populated. No manual entry.

2. **Smart part substitutions** — When a brick/color combo doesn't exist (and many don't), BrickIt auto-substitutes available equivalents.

It's free, runs in your browser (photos never uploaded), no account required.

Feedback welcome: brickit.build
